Create two new classes:
- ThreadSafeCalcTool        Create a Singleton that is thread-safe
- EnumCalcTool              Create a Singleton that is an enum

Modify the Main class to use both classes.
For each Singleton, calculate the four BMIs and print the average.
Both Singletons should produce the same output.
